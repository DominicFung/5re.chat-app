# Welcome to 5re Chat!

Add **ðŸ”¥ chat** to your **React** app and talk to your visitors from your own **Discord server** via a **Discord Bot**!

<HeroButtons />

## Inspiration

<Diagram />

I really didn't really want to pay a subscription fee to add chat to my own websites. My sites are generally low volume, written using NextJS (Including this one) and are side projects. All the other options out there had too many strings attached or was hard to integrate or both. They also force me to learn a new platform - here we just use Discord.

Feel free to use my backend, but it's not free (for me) - Please support me on [Patreon](https://test.coms) if you like the chat system.

## Everything is Open Source!

As long as I'm using ðŸ”¥ chat on my other projects, I plan to support this ðŸ˜Š. Enjoy.
