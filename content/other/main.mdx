# Welcome to 5re Chat!

Add **ðŸ”¥ chat** to your **React** site and talk to your visitors from your own **Discord server** via a **Bot**!

<HeroButtons />

## Inspiration

<Diagram />

I really didn't really want to pay a subscription fee to add chat to my own websites. My sites are generally low volume, written using NextJS (Including this one) and generally side projects. 

I was looking at Discord Bots 1 day and thought - what if I leveraged Discord to help me with chat and BAM this project was born. Feel free to use my backend, but it's not free (for me) - Please support me on [Patreon](https://test.coms) if you like the chat system.

## Everything is Open Source!

As long as I'm using this project on my other projects, I plan to support them ðŸ˜Š. Enjoy.
